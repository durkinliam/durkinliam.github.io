        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Sky Bet, primarily working with Kotlin/JVM to develop resilient backend and event-driven services.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating from the University of Lincoln with a degree in Sports Business Management, I began my career in the gambling industry at William Hill, working in retail. I later joined Sky Bet as a Sports Trader, where I gained experience in the operational side of trading.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time in the trading team, I started learning the basics of programming by building, supporting, and enhancing Excel-based VBA tools used across the department. As the reliance on these tools grew, a small trading-focused technology team was established. When the team began adopting more scalable and supportable technologies, I was offered the opportunity to join them and focus on software engineering full-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since moving into software engineering, I have worked on a variety of projects, from supporting existing services to building new, high-quality services from scratch. As my skills and experience have developed, so has my role within the team. I have progressed from being a junior engineer to a senior engineer, mentoring and guiding junior colleagues and contributing to the strategic direction of the team.
